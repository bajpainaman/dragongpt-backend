How many co ops can I do  and how do they work,"4-Year, 1 Co-op Program:

In this track, students complete one six-month co-op experience during their time at Drexel, which allows them to gain valuable hands-on experience while still graduating in four years. This option is ideal for students who want to enter the workforce sooner while still getting a taste of real-world job experience. It balances academic coursework with a brief period of professional development.
5-Year, 3 Co-op Program:

For students who choose the 5-year, 3 co-op program, they will alternate between six-month periods of full-time study and six-month co-op experiences over the course of five years. This track provides extensive real-world experience, as students get the chance to complete three different co-ops, potentially with different employers or in different roles, which helps them build a strong professional portfolio before graduating. Although it extends the time spent in school by a year, students often graduate with a clearer sense of their career path and a strong network of industry connections.","The number of co-ops a student can participate in at Drexel University depends on several factors, including their chosen major, the number of credits transferred (for transfer students), and their selected academic calendar. 


How Co-ops Work

Co-op at Drexel allows students to gain real-world experience while integrating their academic knowledge. Students can co-op with various employer partners across business, industrial, governmental, research, and non-profit sectors.
